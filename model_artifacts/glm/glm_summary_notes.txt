GLM Summary Interpretation (H3 Grid Crash Frequency)

Model
- Family/Link: Negative Binomial with log link (counts per H3 cell)
- Response: CRASH_COUNT_CELL
- Offset: EXPOSURE_AADT_MXM_365 (defaults to 1.0 here; modeling counts, not rates)
- Observations: 30,419 H3 cells
- Fit: Pseudo R² (CS) ≈ 0.315; Deviance ≈ 13,831; Iterations: 100

Key Findings (interpret coefficients as log rate ratios; exp(coef) is the rate ratio)
- VEHICLE_COUNT: coef ≈ 0.551 (p<0.001) → RR ≈ 1.74
  Cells with higher average vehicles per crash have higher crash counts.
- HEAVY_TRUCK_COUNT: coef ≈ 0.174 (p<0.001) → RR ≈ 1.19
  Greater heavy-truck presence associates with higher crash counts.
- WEATHER1_7 (Rain) share: coef ≈ 0.200 (p≈0.006) → RR ≈ 1.22 per 100%-point; ≈ +2% per +10%-points.
- ROAD_CONDITION_8 (Water): coef ≈ 0.317 (p≈0.055) → borderline positive; ≈ +3.7% per +10%-points.

Unstable / Not Interpretable As-Is
- URBAN_RURAL shares show huge, non-significant coefficients → collinearity (shares sum to 1 + intercept).
- INTERSECTION_RELATED_SHARE, ILLUMINATION_nan_SHARE are not significant and may reflect sparse/placeholder buckets.

Caveats
- No true exposure: AADT × segment length per cell is not available (GEOMETRY empty). Model currently fits counts, which inflates effects for cells with more roadway/exposure.
- Category shares: For each categorical family, shares sum to 1. Keep a reference level (or drop intercept) to avoid non-identifiability.

Recommendations
1) Add true exposure: compute EXPOSURE = Σ(CURR_AADT × length_in_hex × 365) from AADT polylines clipped to H3 cells; retrain.
2) Fix collinearity: drop one reference level for URBAN_RURAL, WEATHER, ROAD_CONDITION, RDWY_SURF_TYPE_CD (and remove any *_nan_SHARE predictors).
3) Refine predictors: replace VEHICLE_COUNT with crash-type mix (e.g., share multi-vehicle, rear-end, turning) and include WZ_* predictors; keep heavy-truck presence.
4) Compare models: try Poisson (config: model.type=glm_poisson) and later GBM (Poisson/Tweedie) with SHAP for factor ranking.

Quick Interpretation Cheatsheet
- exp(coef) > 1: factor increases expected crash count.
- exp(coef) < 1: factor decreases expected crash count.
- For share features: a +10%-point change approximates 0.1 × coef on log scale (small-coef rule of thumb).
