Can you perform a literature review on research papers about different machine learning applications for crash-predictions using traffic data, and the key model architectures (if any) they used? My goal is to solve a problem nuanced enough that it seems like it has never been applied in the real world yet, which is very difficult when considering the size of each state's Department of Transportation (DOT) across the country. Attached is a page of scratch notes taken by prompting a different model on the same issue.

*begin response*
To define a "nuanced" problem that justifies supercomputing resources and feels novel for a DOT context, you need to move beyond **Crash Frequency** (predicting counts) and **Crash Severity** (predicting injury vs. property damage). These are well-trodden paths.

The "frontier" of academic literature right now is **Spatiotemporal Dependency** (how a crash here affects risk *there*) and **Causal Inference** (why it happened, not just that it did).

Here is a literature review summary tailored to your datasets, followed by a specific "Novel" Problem Proposal.

### Part 1: Literature Review of ML in Crash Prediction

Current research can be categorized into three "generations." Your project should aim for **Generation 3** to satisfy the course's "novelty" and "supercomputer" requirements.

#### Generation 1: The "Hotspot" Era (Statistical & Classical ML)
* **Focus:** Treating crashes as independent events on a spreadsheet.
* **Methods:** Poisson Regression, Negative Binomial, Random Forest (RF), XGBoost.
* **Key Papers:**
    * *Chen et al. (2016)* used **Cart & Random Forest** to predict severity, finding that they outperformed logistic regression in handling non-linear relationships.
    * *Scope:* Great for "Contributing Factors" (e.g., finding that "rain + curves = bad"), but fails to capture that roads are connected.
    * **Relevance to you:** You have `FLAGS_2024` (Speeding, Distracted) and `ROADWAY_2024` (Lane Count). These models are good baselines but not "novel."

#### Generation 2: The "Grid" Era (Deep Learning / CNNs)
* **Focus:** Treating the city like an image (pixels = lat/long grids).
* **Methods:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), LSTMs (Time-Series).
* **Key Papers:**
    * *Ma et al. (2017)* used CNNs on crash heatmaps.
    * *Yuan et al. (2018)* used **ConvLSTM** to predict risk changes over time (e.g., "Risk is moving east").
    * **Gap:** Roads aren't pixels; they are networks. A bridge connects two distant points, but a pixel-grid sees them as far apart.

#### Generation 3: The "Network" Era (Graph Neural Networks - GNNs) **<-- TARGET THIS**
* **Focus:** Modeling the road network as a mathematical Graph ($Nodes=$ Intersections, $Edges=$ Road Segments).
* **Methods:** Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), GraphSAGE, Spatiotemporal GNNs.
* **Key Papers:**
    * *Zhou et al. (2020)* and recent 2023-2024 works use **GraphSAGE** to predict crash counts, achieving <22% error by learning "neighbor effects" (e.g., a busy off-ramp causing crashes on the *feeder* road).
    * *Ding et al. (2023)* proposed **"CausalAF"**, a causal generative model to simulate "what-if" safety scenarios, moving beyond simple correlation.
    * **The Nuance:** These models prove that **Crash Risk is Contagious**. Congestion in Segment A propagates risk to Segment B.

### Part 2: The "Nuanced" Real-World Problem Proposal

**Project Title:** *The Domino Effect: Predicting Risk Propagation in Road Networks using Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks.*

**The Real-World Problem:**
Current DOT "Hotspot" maps are reactive and isolated. They flag where crashes *happened*, but they fail to identify **"Risk Source"** vs. **"Risk Sink."**
* *Example:* A poorly timed traffic light at Intersection A causes backups. Drivers speed up to make up time and crash at Segment B (1 mile away).
* *Current Approach:* DOT fixes Segment B (widens it).
* *The Reality:* They should have fixed the light at Intersection A. Segment B was just the "Sink" where the risk materialized.

**The "Novel" Solution (Your Project):**
Use a **Graph Neural Network (GNN)** to model the Pennsylvania road network. Instead of predicting "Will a crash happen here?", you predict **"How does the state of this segment influence the risk of its neighbors?"**

**Why this fits your Data & Course:**
1.  **Supercomputer Justification:** GNNs are computationally expensive. You need to build an Adjacency Matrix of thousands of road segments (`ROADWAY_2024.SEGMENT`).
2.  **Data Utilization:**
    * **Nodes:** Road Segments (joined by `ROUTE` and `SEGMENT` from `ROADWAY_2024`).
    * **Node Features:** `LANE_COUNT`, `SPEED_LIMIT`, `ACCESS_CTRL`.
    * **Dynamic Features:** `TIME_OF_DAY`, `WEATHER` (from `CRASH_2024`).
    * **Target:** `MAX_SEVERITY_LEVEL` or Crash Count.
3.  **The "Live Demo" Visualization:**
    * Show a map of a road network.
    * **Interactive Element:** "Turn off" a road segment (simulate a closure) or "Increase Volume" on one segment.
    * **Result:** Watch the "Risk Colors" change on *neighboring* segments in real-time.

### Implementation Sketch (to put in your proposal)

1.  **Graph Construction (Week 1-3):**
    * Use `ROADWAY_2024` to create your graph.
    * Each `SEGMENT` is a Node.
    * Edges exist if segments are physically connected (you can infer this if `ROUTE` matches and `SEGMENT` IDs are sequential, or use Lat/Lon distance).

2.  **Feature Engineering (Week 4-5):**
    * **Static:** Lane count, speed limit, urban/rural.
    * **Dynamic:** Aggregate crash history by Hour-of-Day. (e.g., "This node is risky at 5 PM").

3.  **Modeling (Week 6-8 on Bridges-AI):**
    * Architecture: **GraphSAGE** (Good for large inductive graphs) or **GCN**.
    * Input: A matrix of road features.
    * Output: A "Risk Score" (0-1) for every node.

4.  **The "Nuance" (Explainability):**
    * Use **GNNExplainer** (a standard library tool). It tells you *which* neighbor contributed most to a node's risk.
    * *Report Finding:* "We found that 30% of crashes on Main St are statistically predicted by conditions on the *adjacent* Highway Ramp, not Main St itself."

**Would you like me to generate the "Technical Challenges" section for this GNN proposal? It requires specific wording about "adjacency matrices" and "heterogeneous graphs" to sound authoritative.**
